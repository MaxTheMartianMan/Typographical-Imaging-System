# Typographical-Imaging-System
Takes any images and turns it into a Typographical Image

Currently only the options folder is available. I am in the process of getting the code ready for release. 
Howerver, I will not have the time to do so the 3rd week of May 2021.

Please forgive any spelling and grammar errors in the TIS options file as I said still getting it ready for release. :)
